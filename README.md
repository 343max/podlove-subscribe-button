## Usage

### Through our CDN

    <script class="podlove-subscribe-button" src="http://cdn.podlove.org/subscribe-button/javascripts/app.js" data-language="de" data-size="small" data-json-data="podcastData"></script>

There are currently three options you can set:

    data-json-data: name of the variable where the button can find information about the podcast (see Podcast data API section)
    data-language: language the texts on the button and popup should be in (currently supports 'de', 'en' and 'ja')
    data-size: size and style of the button ('small', 'medium', 'big', 'big-logo'). All of the sizes can be combinated with 'auto' to adapt the button width to the available space like this: 'big-logo auto'

### Self hosted

Put

    dist/*

into the same folder on a publicly available server. Then add a script tag to the place where you want the button to appear:

    <script class="podlove-subscribe-button" src="http://example.com/subscribe-button/javascripts/app.js" data-language="de" data-size="small" data-json-data="podcastData"></script>

There are currently two options you can set:

    data-json-data: name of the variable where the button can find information about the podcast (see Podcast data API section)
    data-language: language the texts on the button and popup should be in (currently supports 'de', 'en' and 'ja')

### Podcast data API

To work the button needs information about the podcast, which needs to be provided in the following format:

    <script>
      window.podcastData = {
        "title": "Newz of the World",
        "subtitle": "Tim and Mark talk about the Newzâ„¢",
        "description": "Newz of the World is a weekly show about world news. Mark Fonseca Rendeiro and Tim Pritlove come together to present interesting reports and discuss their aspects and possible consequences. Newz of the world wants to be an alternative window to the common media flow and cherry picks interesting developments for you.",
        "cover": "http://meta.metaebene.me/media/newz/newz-logo-600x600.jpg",
        "feeds": [
          {
            "type": "audio",
            "format": "mp3",
            "url": "http://newz-of-the-world.com/feed/mp3",
            "variant": "high"
          },
          {
            "type": "audio",
            "format": "aac",
            "url": "http://newz-of-the-world.com/feed/mp4",
            "variant": "high"
          },
          {
            "type": "audio",
            "format": "ogg",
            "url": "http://newz-of-the-world.com/feed/ogg",
            "variant": "high"
          },
          {
            "type": "audio",
            "format": "opus",
            "url": "http://newz-of-the-world.com/feed/opus",
            "variant": "high"
          }
        ]
      }
    </script>

If everything went right you should see a button that will open a popup with subscribe buttons when clicked.

### Add non-javascript fallback

If you want to provide a fallback when no javascript is present, we recommend to do it like this:

    <script class="podlove-subscribe-button" src="http://example.com/subscribe-button/javascripts/app.js" data-language="de" data-size="small" data-json-data="podcastData"></script>
    <noscript><a href="http://newz-of-the-world.com/feed/mp4">Subscribe to feed</a></noscript>

You can also provide more than one feed link if you have more.
